<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hey there, my name is Dzan, I'm an IT highschool student from Bosnia and Herzegovina, I'm in my junior year of
  highschool and I plan on applying to ETF College in the city of Tuzla to continue my education and fulfill my dreams and goals
  of becoming a software developer.
</p>

<p>I started Angela Yu's 2024 web developmenet bootcamp in August and after a lot of procrastination I finally got up
  and decided to go ahead and complete the course, currently finishing the HTML selection, and excited to move on to CSS as 
  I preffer the creative and visual part of things.

<p>Except for programing, my other interests/hobbies are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Working out</li>
  <li>Walking in nature</li>
  <li>Cars and motorcycles</li>
  <li>Researching topics I'm interested in</li>
  <li>Sleeping lol</li>
</ul>
